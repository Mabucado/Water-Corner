<p>We are Water corner, we wash shoes, wash cars, wash carpets,we have our our merchandise, we sell jackets, we sell hats and caps and shirts.</p>
<p>Water corner started in 2019 as project for us to try and bring in some money for ourselves we as a community put hands together and started as a small car wash then from there decided that we can wash anything that needs to be washed.
We aim to provide opportunity localy for talent to show itself and be developed we relised that the government is failing us as we are sitting at home with degrees.
In a few years we wish to have a store open with all equipment we need we wish have a steady income and create more opportunities. We wish for our brand to grow bigger and a big fan base and costomer base.
